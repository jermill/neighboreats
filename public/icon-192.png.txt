This is a placeholder. In production, you should:
1. Create a 192x192px PNG icon with your NeighborEats branding
2. Create a 512x512px PNG icon with your NeighborEats branding
3. Use tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate all needed sizes
4. Include maskable versions for Android adaptive icons

For now, the SVG icon will be used as fallback.
